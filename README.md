# Headcount

#### Project Overview

We'll build upon a dataset centered around schools in Colorado provided by the Annie E. Casey foundation. What can we learn about education across the state?


**Starting with the CSV data we will:**
* build a "Data Access Layer" which allows us to query/search the underlying data
* build a "Relationships Layer" which creates connections between related data
* build an "Analysis Layer" which uses the data and relationships to draw conclusions

Iterations 1-4 and 6 complete. All spec harness tests are passing. Iteration 5 spec harness test is not applicable, since we opted to complete 6 rather than 5. The output from rake sanitation:all shows zero complaints. The rake has zero failures.
